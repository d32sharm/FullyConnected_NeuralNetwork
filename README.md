# FullyConnected_NeuralNetwork
Implementation of a fully connected neural network with arbitrary number of hidden layers and number of neurons in the hidden layers from scratch.

## fcnet.py 
File contains the implementation code for the vanilla feedforward neural network.

## FullyConnected.ipynb
The network is trained and run on IRIS dataset. This is a very small dataset consisting of 50 samples each of three species of Iris plants. Four features have been used to label this data; the length and width of the sepals and petals. This is a common dataset used in the validation of neural network models due to the linear inseparability of the 3 species. For this reason, a non-linear model must be used. 

This notebook contains the process of training, tuning, and testing the network performance.
